# Website Optimization
---

### Get Started
All the code is available by [clicking here.](https://github.com/ZiyadMobarak/opt_portifolio)
You can access the running website through the following link:

### The Project Rubric
The following requirements have been tested:-
- **index.html** scored 92/100 in the mobile and 95/100 in the desktop, so it achieves more than 90% in both.
- **pizza.html** achieved an average rendering time between 12-17ms. Therefore, it delivers 60fps.
- **pizza.html** average time to resize pizzas is around 0.5ms. Thus, it is less than 5ms.


### About The Code
I must acknowledge that code is written with the help of _udacity_ videos available in _advanced JavaScript Course._

My part of the code is well documented, and hopefully, you won't face an issue going through the code.
